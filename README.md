## Overview
This repository contains a credit scoring model developed to predict the creditworthiness of individuals based on their historical financial data. Various classification algorithms including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Random Forest are implemented and their accuracies are assessed.



## Usage
To use the credit scoring model, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Open the Jupyter notebook `credit_scoring_model.ipynb`.
3. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to load the dataset, preprocess the data, train the classification models, and assess their accuracies.
4. Experiment with different algorithms and parameters to optimize the model performance.

## Results
The accuracies of different classification models are as follows:
- Logistic Regression: 69.6%
- Support Vector Machine (SVM): 93.5%
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): 89.7%
- Random Forest: 98%
